# What do the KUKSA.val Server and data Broker support?
This file contains a clear overview what the KUKSA.val Server and data Broker each supports. It focuses on gRPC and VISS support and also what feeders are supported.

## Supported protocols


| Protocol   |      Server      |  Broker   |
|------------|:----------------:|----------:|
| VISS V1    |      x           |     o     |
| VISS V2    |     x/o          |     o     |
| gRPC       |      x           |     x     |

x = supported; x/o = partly supported; o = not supported


### Server and VISS v1
#### Support for [VISS v1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vehicle-information-service/)
KUKSA.val supports the semantic of VISS v1 but only the new syntax of VISS v2.

Support of semantic for client actions:

| Action        |    Support      |
|-----------    |:---------------:|
| authorize     |       x         |
| getMetadata   |       x         |
| get           |       x         |
| set           |       x         |
| subscribe     |       x         |
| subscription  |       x         |
| unsubscribe   |       x         |
| unsubscribeAll|       o         |

x = supported; o = not supported

### Server and VISS v2

#### Implementation of described components in [VISS v2 Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/viss2-core/):
