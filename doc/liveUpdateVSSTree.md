# Updating/Extending VSS Tree during runtime

Upon startup the kuksa.val server loads a JSON file describing the data strucutre it manages. Usually this is a variant of the [Geniivi Vehicle Signal Specification](https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification/).
If you want to extend or modify this structure in your application, it is not neccesary to modify Genivi VSS, instead you can extend the loaded VSS structure during runtime.

## Overlays updateVSSTree
the updateVSSTree method takes input JSON that follows the same rules as the initial VSS JSON. This is added as an _overlay_ that means:
 - If the new JSON specifies branches, actors, sensors or attribtues or metadata not in the original VSS tree, they will be added
  - If the new JSON refers to existing entries, the changed metadata will be overwritten

We suggest not creating over JSON files directly, but instead writing Genivi VSS YAML files using [Genivi VSS tooling](https://github.com/GENIVI/vss-tools/) to convert them to JSON. That way your extension can be used in the whole VSS ecosystem.

Lets make an example

Consider you want to add a signal and change an existing VSS entry. 

Consider this Genivi VSS-compliant YAML file. We call it `roadster-elon.vspec`

```yaml
# Extend kuksa-val model   
- Vehicle:
  type: branch

- Vehicle.Speed:
  max: 9001
  type: sensor

- Vehicle.Private:
  type: branch

- Vehicle.Private.ThrustersActive:
  datatype: boolean
  type: sensor
```

What happened here? 
 - We changed the allowed max value for Vehicle. Speed. This value is already in genivi VSS, however in our use case we need to increase the allowed max value
  - We add a completely new signal `ThrustersActive` in the `Vehicle.Private` branch

Please note, that due to current vss-tools limitations you need to recreate the branch structure with all intermediate branches you need in the yaml.

Use the Genivi tools to generate a JSON

```
  python3 vspec2json.py -i :my.id -I ../spec/ roadster-elon.vspec  roadster-elon.json
```

Now let's try on a kuksa-val instance with a vanilla VSS structure.
Use the test client, you can update the VSS tree live:
```
  updateVSSTree roadster-elon.json 
```

Then you can see, the new signal is available and the max speed limit has increased:

**Note:** You may need the [super-admin-metadata.json.token](../certificates/jwt/super-admin-metadata.json.token) for authorization. 

## Hot-patching with updateMetaData
if you just want to add or change a single metadata item in a signal or sensor, going through the whole VSS tooling may be a littel cumbersome. But you can use the test client to update metadata of a single path directly, if you have the permission to modify metadata:
```
  updateMetaData updateMetaData Vehicle.Speed '{"max":9999}'
```

**Note:**: `updateMetaData` only do one-level-deep shallow merge. If more level update required, use `updateVSSTree` instead.

## Limitations
As the Input data to `updateVSSTree` as well as `updateMetaData`is merged with the existing data structure, there is no way to _remove_ previosuly added elements.

This feature schould be considered Beta quality.
Similar to the initial JSON, there is not much input verification going on. We _check_ that you provide syntactically valid JSON, we _trust_ that it is a valid VSS structure. Therefore, or systemd esing suggestion is doing all the neccesary potentially dangerous data structure modifcations during an initialiazation phase.
